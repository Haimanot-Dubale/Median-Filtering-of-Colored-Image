# Median-Filtering-of-Colored-Image
The retrieval of the original image quality is always a challenging task in the area of image processing. A huge number of techniques were used to denoising the image. A new approach is proposed for eliminating salt and paper noise. The methodology suggested is based on a different median filter applied. 
The Median filter is a nonlinear digital filtering technique,often used to remove noise. Such noise reduction is a typical pre-processing step to improve the results of later processing (for example, edge detection on an image).Median filtering is very widely used in digital image processing because under certain conditions, it preserves edges whilst removing noise. The main idea of the median filter is to run through the signal entry by entry, replacing each entry with the median of neighboring entries.
Note that if the window has an odd number of entries, then the median is simple to define: it is just the middle value after all the entries in the window are sorted numerically.
